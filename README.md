1. Project Setup and Structure:

We started by setting up a new React app using create-react-app. This provided us with a basic project structure, including the src folder where most of our code resides.

2. Components:

We organized the app into components to keep the code modular and maintainable.

UserCard Component (UserCard.js): This component is responsible for displaying individual user information. It receives a user object as a prop and displays the user's avatar, username, and profile link.

Navbar Component (Navbar.js): The navbar contains a brand name and a "Get Users" button. It receives a getUsers function as a prop, which is called when the button is clicked.

Loader Component (Loader.js): This component displays a simple loading animation. It's shown when the app is fetching data from an API.

3. API Data Fetching:

We created a getUsers function in the App.js component to make an API call to the GitHub API (https://api.github.com/users). When the "Get Users" button is clicked, this function fetches a list of GitHub users and updates the users state variable.

4. Styling:

We used CSS to style the components for a better user interface. Each component has its own CSS file (UserCard.css, Navbar.css, Loader.css) to define its specific styles. We added basic styling to make the app look visually appealing, including rounded borders, shadows, and hover effects.

5. State Management:

We used the useState hook from React to manage the state of the app. The users state holds the fetched user data, and the loading state is used to control whether the loader animation is shown while data is being fetched.

6. Rendering Components:

In the App.js component, we render the Navbar component at the top, followed by a grid of UserCard components. If the loading state is true, the Loader component is shown to indicate that data is being fetched.

7. Click Event Handling:

The "Get Users" button in the Navbar component triggers the getUsers function when clicked. This function fetches data from the GitHub API and updates the users state with the fetched data.

8. Improvements and Extensions:

This app provides a simple implementation that meets the requirements you provided. However, there are several areas where you could make improvements or add features:

Error Handling: Implement error handling for API fetch failures.
Pagination: Implement pagination for fetching more users.
User Details: Add a feature to display more detailed user information on a separate page.
Search Functionality: Implement a search feature to filter users.
Responsive Design: Improve the app's appearance on different screen sizes.
Unit Testing: Write tests for components and functions using testing libraries like react-testing-library or jest.
